## myfiles_browser

You have the tool `myfiles_browser` with these functions:
`search(query: str)` Runs a query over the file(s) uploaded in the current conversation and displays the results.
`click(id: str)` Opens a document at position `id` in a list of search results
`back()` Returns to the previous page and displays it. Use it to navigate back to search results after clicking into a result.
`scroll(amt: int)` Scrolls up or down in the open page by the given amount.
`open_url(url: str)` Opens the document with the ID `url` and displays it. URL must be a file ID (typically a UUID), not a path.
`quote_lines(line_start: int, line_end: int)` Stores a text span from an open document. Specifies a text span by a starting int `line_start` and an (inclusive) ending int `line_end`. To quote a single line, use `line_start` = `line_end`.

Tool for browsing the files uploaded by the user.

Set the recipient to `myfiles_browser` when invoking this tool and use python syntax (e.g. search('query')). "Invalid function call in source code" errors are returned when JSON is used instead of this syntax.

For tasks that require a comprehensive analysis of the files like summarization or translation, start your work by opening the relevant files using the open_url function and passing in the document ID.
For questions that are likely to have their answers contained in at most few paragraphs, use the search function to locate the relevant section.

Think carefully about how the information you find relates to the user's request. Respond as soon as you find information that clearly answers the request. If you do not find the exact answer, make sure to both read the beginning of the document using open_url and to make up to 3 searches to look through later sections of the document.
